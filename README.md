# 📊 Sales Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a supermarket sales dataset to uncover insights about **sales trends, customer behavior, and order patterns**.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes columns such as `ORDERDATE`, `QUANTITYORDERED`, `PRICEEACH`, `SALES`, `DEALSIZE`, and `PRODUCTLINE`, providing valuable business insights.  

## 🔍 Steps Performed  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handled missing values and formatted date columns.  
2. **Data Visualization** – Used Pie Chart, Histogram, Line Chart, and Bar Chart.  
3. **Sales Trend Analysis** – Identified peak sales in 2019 and a decline in 2020 (COVID-19 impact).  
4. **Customer Insights** – Determined top revenue-generating customers.  
5. **Order Status Evaluation** – Assessed shipping success, cancellations, and disputes.  

## 📈 Key Findings  
- **Sales were highest in 2019 but dropped in 2020** due to external factors like COVID-19.  
- **Few key customers contribute to most of the revenue**, indicating dependency.  
- **Order frequency follows seasonal trends**, affecting inventory needs.  
- **Most orders were successfully shipped**, with minimal cancellations.  

## 🚀 Future Scope  
- **Predict future sales trends** using machine learning models.  
- **Segment customers** for better marketing strategies.  
- **Optimize inventory** based on demand fluctuations.  
- **Improve order processing** efficiency to reduce delays.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Git & GitHub**
